# Vamshi Final Year Project

## Automated Vulnerability Assessment and Security Analysis

This project is developed as part of my Final Year Engineering Project. It focuses on automatically identifying security vulnerabilities in a given website or web application URL, analyzing associated risks, and providing remediation solutions.

The system is fully automated and includes an additional voice-based feature that delivers vulnerability findings through audio output, enhancing usability and accessibility.

## Project Objectives
- Automate vulnerability assessment for web applications
- Detect security weaknesses from a given website URL
- Analyze and categorize risk severity levels
- Provide remediation and mitigation solutions
- Enhance accessibility using voice-based output
- Support future features such as downloadable reports
